#  humhub-themes-TodGmbH
Based on the FlatHub theme by Alexandra Travkina - [thrashed.ru](http://thrashed.ru)
I "WebCrew", did a lot of changes and fixed a lot of issues and bugs. 

!!Your help is urgently wanted to fix some of the few bugs which are left.

## Features
- dark flat design
- Sidebar left position
- Custom main menu
- Login page video background, or only by modal
- Grid images
- Lightbox images
- Slider block
- and other changes

## Has to be fixed and reworked (You are welcome to help)
- WIKI pages need a sidebar with the default sidebar widgets like the menu etc.
- The File Sharing Module page needs also the sidebar for better navigation between the network pages
- Some links of the main top navigation are in need of a hover info text (some links working with info text, some not)

## Install
- Extract archive and rename to TodGmbH.
- Put folder in: yousite.com/themes

## Settings
- You can change intro videos in folder: ../TodGmbH/video
- You can change slider settings in file: ../TodGmbH/views/dashboard/widgets/share.php
